# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

Your BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure of your weight compared to your height. 

I used Flutter themes to create coherent branding.  
I created multi-pages using Flutter Routes and Navigator.  
I extracted and refactored Flutter Widgets with a click of the button.  
I passed functions as parameters and fields.  
I used the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.  
I used custom colour palettes by using hex codes.  
I customised Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.  
I used Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
